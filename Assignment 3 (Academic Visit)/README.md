## Assignment 3 (Academic Visit to HUAWEI and PETRONAS)
On 17 November 2023, we visited Petronas Digital located at Menara ExxonMobil and HUAWEI Customer Solution Innovation Centre (CSIC) in Kuala Lumpur for industry insights. The PETRONAS visit broadened our understanding of a software engineer's pivotal role and the essential skills, including analytical skills and continuous learning, emphasized by Mr Roman Kvaska. At HUAWEI, we encountered cutting-edge technologies, expanding our comprehension of ICT and its impact on daily life. Despite the short and rushed nature of the visit, it proved highly informative. The overall experience was great and memorable, fostering a desire to explore more industries in similar visits in the future. A special thanks to our lecturer, Dr Aryati Bakri, for organising this insightful trip, and we look forward to exploring more industries in future visits.

## Reflection 
From the visit to PETRONAS, I learned that AI should function as an idea generator, underscoring the importance of validating every outcome it produces. It also imparted the lesson to focus on my passions, acknowledging that I can't know everything, and emphasized the importance of continuous self-improvement to align values with skills. Whilst from the visit HUAWEI, I learned that innovations like the autonomous grocery purchasing system can significantly simplify our lives by calculating the total cost in the cart without the need for item scanning. This not only saves time but also reduces cashier and barcode sticker costs, showcasing how technology can enhance convenience and streamline processes while saving money.
