## Assignment 2 (UTMDigital)

On December 5, 2023, UTM Digital hosted a virtual talk about UTMDigital - our digital university driver, followed by a physical visit to their building on December 13, 2023. During the visit, we explored various areas, including the expansive office space capable of accommodating 60 staff members and the UTM Digital Care office, where we learned about their role in addressing ICT issues. The tour concluded with a visit to the highly-secured data center responsible for managing and safeguarding student, lecturer, and UTM staff data. Despite restrictions on photography due to confidentiality, the visit provided valuable insights, sparking enthusiasm for our future careers post-bachelor's degree completion. A special thanks to Dr Aryati Bakri for her effective communication, contributing to the success of the trip and deepening our understanding of UTM Digital's operations.
