## Assignment (Design Thinking)
From the project, I learnt the importance of collaborative work in groups for producing a comprehensive report, video, and presentation. Design thinking, a critical process in problem-solving through collaboration and innovation, highlighted the significance of skills such as teamwork, problem-solving, communication, analysis, creativity, and influencing others in today's workforce. The course also stressed the necessity of documenting the design thinking process, covering empathy, definition, ideation, prototyping, and testing.
