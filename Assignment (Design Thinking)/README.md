From the project, I learnt the importance of collaborative work in groups for producing a comprehensive report, video, and presentation. Design thinking, a critical process in problem-solving through collaboration and innovation, highlighted the significance of skills such as teamwork, problem-solving, communication, analysis, creativity, and influencing others in today's workforce. The course also stressed the necessity of documenting the design thinking process, covering empathy, definition, ideation, prototyping, and testing.

### Reflection
My goal is to become a skilled and innovative Data Engineer in the future. I hope to apply what I did learn during my studies and develop solutions for real-life problems and challenges. Design thinking influences my goal in thinking solutions and becoming a creative problem-solver. It allows me to learn and refine solutions creatively while collaborating with others. To improve my potential in industry, Iâ€™ll master programming skills, attend workshops, participate in hackathon, and become an outstanding student amongst others.
