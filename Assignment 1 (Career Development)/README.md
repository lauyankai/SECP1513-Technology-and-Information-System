## Assignment 1 (Career Development)
On 28 October 2023, PPG Malaysia had organised a Meet-and-Greet session with UTM's 2u2i Data Engineering programme first-year students at Recreational Forest UTM Skudai. Through the talk given by PPG and Mr Zamarul, we were offered valuable insight into the culture of work at PPG, and Mr Zamarulâ€™s remarkable journey, from his early days as the first cohort of Data Engineering student at UTM, to an intern, and then to his current position as a senior specialist at PPG. The talk not only focuses on the working culture at PPG, technologies and having the opportunity to learn on project management, but also shared a firsthand experience of professional growth such as having a good communication skill in order to communicate technically and nontechnically.

### Reflection
Mr Zamarul's journey, from intern to senior specialist at PPG, left a profound impact on me. He emphasized the importance of being a well-rounded individual, introducing resources like W3Schools and LinkedIn for personal growth. His insights will guide my path in Data Engineering. PPG's workplace culture, featuring cutting-edge cloud technologies and project management opportunities, fosters both personal and company success. Recognizing the need for continuous improvement in technical, communication, and problem-solving skills, I aim to participate in technical events and projects during my studies. Post-graduation, my goal is to secure a position at an MNC like PPG, applying and making an impact with these skills.
