## Assignment 1 (Career Development)

On 28 October 2023, PPG Malaysia had organised a Meet-and-Greet session with UTM's 2u2i Data Engineering programme first-year students at Recreational Forest UTM Skudai. Through the talk given by PPG and Mr Zamarul, we were offered valuable insight into the culture of work at PPG, and Mr Zamarulâ€™s remarkable journey, from his early days as the first cohort of Data Engineering student at UTM, to an intern, and then to his current position as a senior specialist at PPG. The talk not only focuses on the working culture at PPG, technologies and having the opportunity to learn on project management, but also shared a firsthand experience of professional growth such as having a good communication skill in order to communicate technically and nontechnically.
